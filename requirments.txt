Clostra Backend Programming Challenge

---

Write a simple analytics service that accepts analytics reports as GET requests of the form:

`/collect?cid=<UUID>`

where `cid` is a unique client ID. The response should be `200` OK with an empty body.

For testing purposes, the `collect` endpoint should accept an optional query parameter `d=<UNIX timestamp>`, which can be used to override the timestamp associated with a given analytics report.

---

The service should maintain a count of daily active users (unique cid's seen) for each GMT day. 

The service should also support queries of the form:

`/daily_uniques?d=<ISO 8601 date>`

which should return the number of unique users seen for the given GMT day;

and of the form:

`/monthly_uniques?d=<ISO 8601 date>`

which should return the number of unique users seen in the month prior to and including the given GMT day.

The unique user counts may be approximate rather than precise if you can reason about accuracy.

---

The system should be robust to restarts, but it is not necessary to retain data or support queries for dates older than 60 days.

---

Design for performance on a single machine and low operational cost.
